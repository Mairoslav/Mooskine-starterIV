// 00:31 Notebook is a simple class with two (let) properties: name and creationDate. It also has a list of notes (var). And within extensio, some helper methods for adding and removing notes.
// 00:45 Now let's look at Note, move to 'Note.swift'...

/*
class Notebook {
    /// The name for the notebook
    let name: String

    /// The date the notebook was created
    let creationDate: Date

    /// The notes contained by the notebook
    var notes: [Note] = []

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        creationDate = Date()
        notes = []
    }

    /// Add a new note to the notebook
    func addNote() {
        notes.append(Note())
    }

    /// Removes the note at a specific index
    func removeNote(at index: Int) {
